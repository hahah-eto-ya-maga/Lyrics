                I do the same <span data-word="thing" class="miss_word">(1)...</span>, I told you that I never would <br>
                I told you I changed, even when I knew I never could <br>
                I know that I can't find <span data-word="nobody" class="miss_word">(2)...</span> else as good as you <br>
                I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey <br><br>
                I get drunk, wake up, I'm wasted still <br>
                I realize the <span data-word="time" class="miss_word">(3)...</span> that I wasted here <br>
                I feel like you can't feel the way I feel <br>
                I'll be fucked up if you can't be <span data-word="right" class="miss_word">(4)...</span> here <br><br>
                Oh-whoa (oh-whoa, whoa) <br>
                Oh-whoa (oh-whoa, whoa) <br>

                I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here <br><br>
                [Chorus] <br><br>
                When I'm away from you, I miss your <span data-word="touch" class="miss_word">(5)...</span> <br>
                You're the reason I believe in love <br>
                It's been <span data-word="difficult" class="miss_word">(6)...</span> for me to trust (ooh-ooh) <br>
                And I'm afraid that I'ma fuck it up <br>
                Ain't no way that I can leave you <span data-word="stranded" class="miss_word">(7)...</span> <br>
                'Cause you ain't never left me empty-handed <br>
                And you know that I know that I can't live without you <br>
                So, baby, stay <br><br><br>
                Oh-whoa (oh-whoa, whoa) <br>
                Oh-whoa (oh-whoa, whoa) <br>
                Oh-whoa (oh-whoa, whoa) <br>
                I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here <br><br>

                Back in <span data-word="black" class="miss_word">(1)...</span> <br>
                I hit the sack <br>
                I've been too long, I'm <span data-word="glad" class="miss_word">(2)...</span> to be back <br>
                Yes, I'm let loose <br>
                From the noose <br>
                That's kept me <span data-word="hanging" class="miss_word">(3)...</span> about <br>
                I've been looking at the sky <br>
                'Cause it's gettin' me high <br>
                Forget the <span data-word="hearse" class="miss_word">(4)...</span> 'cause I never die <br>
                I got nine lives <br>
                Cat's eyes <br>
                Abusin' every one of them and <span data-word="running" class="miss_word">(5)...</span> wild <br><br>
                'Cause I'm back <br>
                Yes, I'm back <br>
                Well, I'm back <br>
                Yes, I'm back <br>
                Well, I'm back, back <br>
                Well, I'm back in black <br>
                Yes, I'm back in black <br><br>
                Back in the back <br>
                Of a <span data-word="Cadillac" class="miss_word">(6)...</span> <br>
                Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack <br>
                Yes, I'm in a bang <br>
                With a gang <br>
                They've got to <span data-word="catch" class="miss_word">(7)...</span> me if they want me to hang <br>
                'Cause I'm back on the track <br>
                And I'm beatin' the flack <br>
                Nobody's gonna get me on <span data-word="another" class="miss_word">(8)...</span> rap <br>
                So look at me now <br>
                I'm just makin' my play <br>
                Don't try to push your <span data-word="luck" class="miss_word">(9)...</span>, just get out of my way <br><br>
                [Chorus] <br><br>
                Well, I'm back, yes, I'm back <br>
                Well, I'm back, yes, I'm back <br>
                Well, I'm back, back <br>
                Well, I'm back in black <br>
                Yes, I'm back in black <br><br>
                Oh, yeah <br>
                Oh, yeah <br>
                Take my love <br>
                Oh, yeah, yeah <br>
                Oh, yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah <br><br>

                When the days are cold <br>
                And the cards all <span data-word="fold" class="miss_word">(1)...</span> <br>
                And the saints we see are all made of gold <br>
                When your dreams all <span data-word="fail" class="miss_word">(2)...</span> <br>
                And the ones we hail <br>
                Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale <br><br>
                I wanna hide the truth <br>
                I wanna <span data-word="shelter" class="miss_word">(3)...</span> you <br>
                But with the beast inside <br>
                There's nowhere we can hide <br>
                No matter what we <span data-word="breed" class="miss_word">(4)...</span> <br>
                We still are made of greed <br>
                This is my kingdom come <br>
                This is my kingdom come <br><br>
                When you feel my heat, look into my <span data-word="eyes" class="miss_word">(5)...</span> <br>
                It's where my demons hide <br>
                It's where my demons hide <br>
                Don't get too close, it's dark <span data-word="inside" class="miss_word">(6)...</span> <br>
                It's where my demons hide <br>
                It's where my demons hide <br><br>
                At the curtain's call <br>
                It's the last of all <br>
                When the lights fade out, all the <span data-word="sinners crawl" class="miss_word">(7)...</span> <br>
                So they dug your grave <br>
                And the masquerade <br>
                Will come <span data-word="calling" class="miss_word">(8)...</span> out at the mess you've made <br><br>
                Don't wanna let you down <br>
                But I am hell-bound <br>
                Though this is all for you <br>
                Don't wanna hide the <span data-word="truth" class="miss_word">(9)...</span> <br>
                No matter what we breed <br>
                We still are made of <span data-word="greed" class="miss_word">(10)...</span> <br>
                This is my kingdom come <br>
                This is my kingdom come <br><br>
                [Chorus] <br><br>
                They say it's what you make <br>
                I say it's up to fate <br>
                It's woven in my <span data-word="soul" class="miss_word">(11)...</span> <br>
                I need to let you go <br>
                Your eyes, they shine so bright <br>
                I wanna save that light <br>
                I can't <span data-word="escape" class="miss_word">(12)...</span> this now <br>
                Unless you show me how <br><br>
                [Chorus]
